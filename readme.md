# Know eve ships now.

I don't code much and i just chrunched it out - so don't be shocked by the bad code quality.
This project basically creates flashcards from a list of ship.

## Usage

execute knowEveShipsNow.py
It will read a file called ship_list.txt and pull Information about the ship from eve uni page.
It will then write the ship information into a file called "anki_import.txt" which can be used with the free flashcard
  software "Anki" http://ankisrs.net/
  Extending the code to export the lists in another format should be simple
  
  enjoy.
